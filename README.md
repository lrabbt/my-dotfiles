# My Dotfiles #

## Objectives ##

Compact and move useful dotfiles between environments.

## Installation ##

The installation script `install.sh` will install Oh My Zsh! and create simlinks to the dotfiles using [effuse](#effuse).

For that to work, check the effuse section on how to install it. After installation, just run

```sh
sh install.sh
```
